# Giraffe Robot for Q&A Sessions

This project implements a ceiling-mounted robot designed to autonomously bring a microphone to participants in a conference room during Q&A sessions. It combines URDF modeling, kinematics, trajectory planning, and inverse dynamics control using the Pinocchio robotics library.

## ðŸ¤– Robot Specifications

- **Mounting**: Ceiling at 4 meters height
- **Reachable Area**: 5 Ã— 12 meters (horizontal), down to 1 meter height
- **Degrees of Freedom**: 5
  - 2 Revolute joints (spherical base)
  - 1 Prismatic joint (telescopic extension)
  - 2 Revolute joints (microphone orientation)
- **End-effector Task**: Reach any location with a 30Â° pitch orientation of the microphone

This will:
- Load the robot model
- Compute forward kinematics and Jacobians
- Generate a minimum jerk trajectory
- Apply task-space computed torque control with null-space optimization
- Print control torques and plot the trajectory

## ðŸ“Œ To Do

- Implement a time-based simulation loop with integration
- Add MeshCat or RViz visualization
- Tune PD gains for 7s settling time without overshoot
- Add launch files for ROS/Gazebo integration (optional)

---

## ðŸ“· Visualization

You can visualize the URDF in RViz or using MeshCat via Pinocchio.
